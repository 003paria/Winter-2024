# Template p5 project

In this game you take on a mission as a marine biologist to cunduct research by scuba diving into the Pacific Ocean.
Your research group needs you to find certain rare species. So your goal is to find these special species by pointing your finger to them.
But you gotta be very fast because your oxygen tank might run out at any moment!!

Once you have found all the 7 targets, you will retrun to your research group a hero!
But if you run out of time, you will just have to try again (unless your research group kicks you out before you get another chance).
