Voice Jam : Storytelling with the computer! 

Paria Jafarian

This is an interactive storytelling game of sorts. 
It is not interactive in the sense of "choose your adventure" type of narratives but rather in sense that it is a collaboration with the program because it is pretty much treated as a friend that helps you write funny and nonsensical stories.  

Here are the instructions: 

I will start off the sentence every time you press the Space key, and you'll finish it by talking out loud.
But in order for me to understand you, you must begin your sentence by saying "start writing" aloud and you must always end your sentence by saying "stop".
If the sentence is not displayed after you said "stop", it means that I did not hear you properly so you need to repeat yourself again.
Whenever you feel like you're happy with the story, instead of ending the story with the usual "stop", you must end your last sentence with "story over".
You can have fun between your sentences by playing around with the different accents available as well as with setting the rate and the pitch!

Press the Enter key to start the game.
