**Framework:** This game is developed using the Phaser framework, a powerful JavaScript library for creating 2D games for the web. Phaser provides robust features for game development, including physics simulation, asset loading, and scene management, making it ideal for building arcade-style games like Bug Exterminator.

**Inspiration:** Bug Buster draws inspiration from classic arcade games where players must eliminate pests before they cause chaos. Players take on the role of a bug exterminator tasked with squashing pesky bugs infesting a computer program. The game features cartoon insects crawling around the code, and players must swiftly squash them by typing the right keywords to earn points.

**Gameplay:** The gameplay is simple yet addictive. Bugs spawn randomly on the screen, and players must type the correct keyword to squash them. Each squashed bug earns the player points. However, players must be quick as bugs move at varying speeds, and if any bug reaches the right side of the screen, the game ends.

**Additional Information:** Bug Exterminator features multiple bug types, each with its own movement speed, adding to the challenge. The game also includes a score counter to track the player's progress.
